## Examples

Set a TTL of 3600 (1 hour) for all keys without a TTL, processing 1000 keys at a time

```bash
expiredis -limit -1 -count 1000 -set-ttl 3600 -dry-run=false
```

Delete all keys matching `foo:*`
```bash
expiredis -limit -1 -pattern "foo:*" -delete -dry-run=false
```

Reduce expiry by 86400 seconds of keys matching `bar:*` with a minimum TTL of 86400 (1 day)
```bash
expiredis -limit -1 -pattern "bar:*" -subtract-ttl 86400 -dry-run=false
```
